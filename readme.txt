Add and display ads randomly on your blog. Sort ads randomly, limit the number of ads that appear, display ads in posts, widgets or template files.

== Description ==

The Ads plugin allows you to add advertisements to your blog.  You can add advertisements to your posts, pages or Text Widgets via the shortcode.  You can also add ads to your site by adding a function to your theme's template files.

You have full control over how many ads get displayed as well as their sort order.

**Important**

As of version 1.2.0, all custom callback functions (ie. `callback_function`) need to be returned by the `dfads_allowed_callback_functions()` function. To do this, add your allowed custom callback functions like this:

```
add_filter( 'dfads_allowed_callback_functions', function ( array $functions ) {
	$functions[] = 'my_first_custom_callback_function';
	$functions[] = 'my_second_custom_callback_function';

	return $functions;
} );
```
